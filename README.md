# Alumni Meet 2026

A single-page web experience with an Express backend for the JUIT Alumni Meet 2026. The site blends a curated visual story with structured event details so alumni can discover the schedule, gallery, and organizing team in one place.

## Features

- **Single-page design** built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for quick load times.
- **Dynamic content** fetched from `/api/event`, making it easy to tweak copy, links, and lineup in `data/eventData.js`.
- **Event essentials**: hero, purpose, activities timeline, gallery, eligibility, registration with Google Form + WhatsApp links, leadership profiles, and the student task force.
- **Responsive layout** that adapts cleanly across desktops, tablets, and phones.
- **Express backend** serving both the static site and JSON API.
